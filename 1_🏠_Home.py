Welcome to VaxTrackAI, the Africa Vaccine Dropout Prediction App. 

**Dropout** in immunization programs is typically defined as a coverage rate greater than or equal to 10%. This means that if the percentage of children who start the vaccination series but do not complete it is 10% or more, it's considered a dropout issue. A dropout rate above **10%** often indicates a problem with program utilization or service delivery.

This tool predicts the likelihood that a child will **drop out between DTP1 and DTP3** vaccinations based on:
- Antigen coverage (DTP1, DTP3, PCV1, PCV3, MCV1, MCV3, OPV1, OPV3, BCG)
- Country
- Region
- Population data (population under 1 year old)

Navigate between **Predict** and **Insights** pages to explore the model.

    "DTP3": "**DTP3** is the third and final dose in the DTP series. Completion of this dose is critical for full protection against these deadly diseases.",
    
    "PCV1": "**PCV1** is the first dose of the Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine. It protects infants against pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis. Typically given at 6 weeks.",
    
    "PCV3": "**PCV3** is the third dose in the PCV vaccine series, ensuring long-term immunity against pneumococcal diseases in young children.",
    
    "MCV1": "**MCV1** is the first dose of the Measles-Containing Vaccine, usually administered at 9 months of age to protect against measles.",
    
    "MCV3": "**MCV3** (or second measles dose in some countries) boosts immunity and increases protection against measles in older children.",
    
    "OPV1": "**OPV1** is the first dose of the Oral Polio Vaccine, which protects against poliovirus. Typically given at birth or 6 weeks.",
    
    "OPV3": "**OPV3** is the final dose in the OPV series, crucial for building strong immunity against polio, especially in high-risk areas.",
    
    "BCG": "**BCG** is a single-dose vaccine given at birth to protect against severe forms of tuberculosis, especially TB meningitis in children."

        - VaxTrackAI was built by training a Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) model on [population](https://idataportal.afro.who.int/dataset/population/resource/28a1db7b-2c8f-4433-bef2-e902d5a9cf09?view_id=5e08af5b-41c2-478b-b9b6-54d9525d7b94) and [vaccination coverage](https://idataportal.afro.who.int/dataset/ri_coverage_all_antigens/resource/7c5b7d34-b285-4bb8-ad66-ac23c8b23689?view_id=a28630bf-7e25-4da5-b424-eaa377128718) data from WHO African Region Data Portal.
        - The model achieved accuracy of **95%** and an AUC score of **98%**.
        - Features such as MCV3 and BCG are the most influential features for the model's predictions. PCV1 is the next most important, followed by MCV1, and Population.
